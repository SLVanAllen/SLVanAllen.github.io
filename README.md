### Professional Self-Assessment

As my time in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University comes to a close, I am taking the time to reflect on my journey and all I have accomplished.  I remember my first day in the program and how nervous I was. I had no idea what to expect and how significantly this degree would shape my skillset as well as my professional direction. I came into this program with over 12 years of experience in the testing, troubleshooting, and repair of avionics radar subsystems. This degree expanded that foundation and allowed me to connect my hardware expertise with software development. As I progressed in the program, I was able to take something valuable from each course, preparing me to move into roles that bridge electronics, software, and data.

Throughout my career in avionics, teamwork has always been essential. However, collaborating for the purpose of software development was a new experience. In my Software Development Lifecycle course, I had the opportunity to work in scrum teams and experience the full software development lifecycle. I gained experience gathering requirements, planning sprints, developing and testing, and even participating in retrospectives. I was able to see the true importance of each scrum role and what they contribute to the process and learned that every task contributes to the overall success of the system. The most impactful aspect of this experience was the focus on communication and continuous improvement. Being able to work with stakeholders, asking questions and adjusting as needed reinforced the importance of continuous improvement.

Data Structures and Algorithms was one of the most challenging courses for me initially, but it became one of the most valuable. At first, my focus was making the programs work. Over time, I learned to think about efficiency, scalability, and design trade-offs. Working with different data structures and analyzing them using Big-O notation, I developed a stronger understanding of how to weigh decisions—when to prioritize speed, when to conserve memory and how the choice of structure affects performance. This changed the way I approach writing code. Instead of solving a problem one way, I now weigh the benefits and disadvantages of different solutions. 

Working with databases was especially rewarding. Learning SQL, writing queries, and performing joins was challenging at first, but once I understood how the tables relate to each other, I saw how useful organized data can be. I was able to integrate databases into multiple projects, which helped reinforce the practical side of what I was learning. During this time, I actually trained at my current place of employment and gained hands-on IT data center training where I assisted with reporting workflows using QBEs and ObjectPAL scripts. This gave me some exposure to querying and automation. The database experience I gained in this program strengthened that foundation and gave me more confidence in my ability to design and interact with relational databases in real-world settings.

Another course I took in the computer science program was Secure Coding, where I developed and presented a security policy. For this project, I had to identify security risks, evaluate and rank them, propose mitigation strategies, and present everything formally. It pushed me to think more broadly about security, realizing that how something is implemented can affect not just the system, but the people that rely on it. Working through these ideas strengthened my ability to communicate complex technical issues clearly and professionally, helping me to make recommendations that were both practical and easy to understand.

Security has been a consistent and intentional focus throughout my coursework. From secure coding practices and role-based access control (RBAC) to encryption, decryption, and database permissions, all of my courses made security a priority. The focus of security really stuck out to me and shifted my mindset. Now, I think about security not just as a feature but as a foundational part of the entire system.

Completing this program and developing my ePortfolio has given me the confidence I needed to shift my career focus. I now have strong understanding of algorithms, database design, and secure development. My concentration in Software Engineering helped me see development as more of an engineering process rather than just coding. What makes my background unique is the combination of hands-on avionics experience and formal software engineering education. I bring my troubleshooting skills, precision, and discipline from the hardware world, paired with software development knowledge and data focused thinking earned through the completion of my computer science degree.

I have selected three artifacts that showcase what I have both learned and accomplished over the course of my time in the computer science program. The first artifact is from CS405 Secure Coding, where I worked on a buffer overflow program in C++. I made the input validation modular, reusable, and testable, so it could be used in a real-world scenario. This project not only reinforced secure coding practices but allowed me to show how I can plan for potential vulnerabilities, coordinate mitigation strategies, and communicate all of these things clearly.  This aligns with the program outcome of developing a security mindset and supporting collaborative decision-making.

The second artifact is from CS300 Data Structures and Algorithms. I was able to improve a project that sorts computer science courses and their prerequisites by fixing the data structure and making the program more efficient. I also cleaned up the code, making it easier to understand and maintain. This artifact shows how I approach problem-solving using algorithmic principles and how I manage trade-offs involved in design choices.

The third artifact is another enhancement made to the same CS300 project used in my second artifact. I took the same program and demonstrated my ability to integrate a database. I connected the program to a local MongoDB database so course information could be stored and updated more easily, rather than relying on a CSV file. This enhancement demonstrates practical software development skills, strategies for building collaborative environments, and my security mindset. The addition of a database to this program is a solution that are scalable, secure, and can be adapted to specific audiences and contexts. 

These artifacts are a direct reflection of my technical abilities in security, algorithms, software design, and databases. Together they demonstrate how much I have learned during my time in the computer science program as well as how I apply these skills to real-world scenarios. Moving forward, I am excited to pursue opportunities that combine electronics, software, and data, where I can continue to grow professionally and contribute a mindset focused on collaboration, security, continuous improvement, and thoughtful system design.


### Code Review


Below is a link to my code review. In the code review, I cover two of my previous assignments that I chose as my artifacts to enhance. This code review will cover the original projects and the enhancements I plan to make to each of them.
