# Artifact 2
## Vector

The artifact that I chose to enhance for the Data Structures and Algorithms enhancement is a project from CS300 Data Structures and Algorithms. It is a program that sorts computer science courses and their perquisites. The program allows users to choose options from a menu. The user can load the courses from a CSV file, print a list of the courses, print a single course and its prerequisites, or quit the program.
	
  I selected this artifact because I felt it was a great showcase of what I have learned over the course of my degree. When I originally did this project, I feel as though I was learning much more than just data structures and algorithms. I honestly still considered myself new to coding. CS300 was a hard class for me because I was still getting a handle on basic coding principles and techniques. Learning data structures and algorithms was tough considering I could barely write a basic program. I was still concerned with the functionality, let alone perfecting the efficiency. But I think the idea of the program was great because it is simple program with a solid foundation in terms of scalability and real world use. It was easy for me to understand what the program needed to do and how it needed to operate. 

Because of the assignment’s clear concept, I think taking the time to clean up the data structure usage shows not only my understanding of data structures, but my ability to understand performance and design tradeoffs. The artifact was improved by cleaning up the data structure and making sure the user is only able to load courses once. This assignment uses a vector and sorting to store the courses and print them. This enhancement shows my understanding of data structures and algorithms by demonstrating my eye for code correctness and time complexity. I took the opportunity to prevent the program from performing unnecessary work, improving the overall efficiency.

I met the course outcomes I anticipated meeting in Module One with this enhancement. I improved the use of my vector and eliminated unnecessary work, which improved the overall efficiency of my program. Making these changes aligns directly with course outcomes three, four, and five. I would expand my outcome coverage plan to encompass course outcomes number two as well. I noticed when implementing my changes that the updates I was making weren’t just about inefficiency; they were about code correctness as well. Although my program worked as is originally, it was not written correctly and therefore could not be considered good in terms of data integrity and reliability. With the enhancements I made, the code is now more reliable which aligns with designing, developing, and delivering professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound. 
	
  When creating the program originally, I would say I was challenged with understanding of how and when to implement which data structures. For this reason, I ended up with some unused logic in my program that I didn’t understand until much later. Now with this enhancement, I would say I was challenged with more so with making sure the performance is not decreased by the refactoring. It was hard to teeter the line of efficiency and readability and testability. I found that although one solution may be cleaner, it may not always be the most efficient which is part of managing tradeoffs in design. Ultimately, I think I implemented the best solution.
